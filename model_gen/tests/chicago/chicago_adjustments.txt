# Building assignments worked nicely overall. However, for some regions
# the square footage was either overestimated or
# underestimated. Overestimation occurred in regions with low population
# but with large industrial complexes that significantly increased the
# square footage. For human population assignments, these industrial
# building complexes were manually tagged to be ignored.
# 
# Underestimation occurred in a few regions due to minor differences
# between LandScan boundaries (that are approximate to 0.5 miles) versus
# the more precise locations in Open Street Map. That is, the regions
# did not have any buildings. Specifically, for the following regions
# the populations were reassigned to their adjacent neighbors with homes
# to accommodate the human population. The adjacent neighbors were
# manually determined by inspecting the neighborhood via Open Street
# Map.
