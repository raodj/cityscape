This directory should contain the data from LandScan on population
distribution.  This data is used to assign people to different homes
in a given area.

Currently, we cannot distribute this data due to licensing agreements
that are are needed from Oak Ridge National Labs (ORNL). However,
users can get this data from ORNL after signing necessary agreements
with them.

This directory should contain the following files:

    dblbnd.adf
    hdr.adf
    prj.adf
    sta.adf
    vat.adf
    w001001.adf
    w001001x.adf
