/** \mainpage Building Generator

   \section Motivation

   Currently the Human Population and Location Simulator (HAPLOS)
   generates buildings in random location to meet the needs on a
   pouplation.  However, generating buildings in random location does
   not provide a sufficiently realistic model for several applications
   including (but not limited to):

   <ul>
   <li>Planning for recovery operations after natural catastrophes</li>
   <li>Targeted Layered Containment (TLC) to contain epidemics</li>
   <li>Design and planning of water distribution systems</li>
   <li>Planning of ad hoc networking infrastructures for urban areas.</li>
   </ul>

   \section Overview

   <p>In order to address the aforementioned shortcoming of HAPLOS,
   this Building Generator has been developed.  The primary objective
   of building generator is to create different types of buildings
   (used by HAPLOS) such as: homes, schools, offices, malls, etc. at
   more realistic locations.</p>

   <p>Currently, identification of appropriate locations to generate
   buildings is accomplished using publicly and freely available data
   from Open Street Maps web-services (see
   https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API).  Currently, the system
   uses a bounding box around the desired city to obtain street data
   and places houses on residential streets.</p>

   \section tools Minimum system requirements

   This software has been designed to primarily run under a Linux
   distribution.  Its operation in Windows or Mac is is not tested nor
   supported. In order to build under Linux the following additional
   (but pretty standard) software tools and libraries are needed:

   <ol>

   <li>A standard install of Autoconf
   (https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) version 2.69 or newer is
   needed.</li>

   <li>A standard install of Automake
   (https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) version 1.14 or newer is
   needed.</li>

   <li>The generated Makefile uses GNU make.  Consequently, GNU make
   (version 4.0 or newer) is needed.</li>
   
   <li>The boost library (specifically: BOOST ASIO and BOOST Property
   Tree) must be installed.</li>

   <li>The C++ source code uses C++11 and requires GCC version 4.9.2
   or newer.</li>

   <li>You will need xfig (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfig) to view
   the figures generated by this tool (xfig is not needed for
   compiling).</li>
   
   </ol>
   
   \section qs Quick start guide

   This section describes the basic operations that can be performed
   to compile and get started with building generation.

   \subsection build Compiling the source

   The software uses a pretty standard autoconf configuration script
   that can be used to create a Makefile and compile the source.


   \note In the following shell commands the `$` signifies the bash
   shell prompt. So you should not copy-paste the `$` character from
   these commands.
   
   First ensure you are in the correct top-level bldgen directory
   using the following shell commands:
   
   \code{.unparsed}
   $ cd bldgen
   $ ls src/Utils.h
   src/Utils.h
   $
   \endcode

   Once you have verified you are in the correct directory, you can
   run autoconf (to generate Makefile(s)) and compile the source code
   using the following commands:

   \code{.unparsed}
   $ autoreconf -i -v
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make doxygen-doc
   \endcode
   
   \subsection run Running the software

   Once you have compiled the software successfully, you can run the
   software using included sample OSM XML file using the command
   below.

   \note In the following shell commands the `$` signifies the bash
   shell prompt. So you should not copy-paste the `$` character from
   these commands.
   
   \code{.unparsed}
   $ cd tests
   $ ../src/bldgen --osm-xml miami.osm --fig-file miami.fig --cache ../cache
   $ fig2dev -L png miami.fig miami.png
   \endcode

   The above command should create an xfig file `tests/miami.fig`. You
   can view that file using xfig via the command below:

   \code{.unparsed}
   $ xfig tests/miami.fig
   \endcode

   You can download additional OSM XML files from Open Street Maps
   (ensure you choose a small region as the data can get large very
   fast) via the following command (see
   https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6#Retrieving_map_data_by_bounding_box:_GET_.2Fapi.2F0.6.2Fmap
   for documentation on OSM API):

   \code{.unparsed}
   $ wget "http://openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=-84.75,39.5,-84.733,39.515" -O "tests/miami.osm"
   \endcode
