	\brief All the boost headers are placed in this header for use
	with precompiled header functionality.
	
	Note that the property tree headers are included here so that the
	header can be compiled as a "pre-compiled header" to make overall
	compilation (particularly during development) go much faster (~3x
	faster with a good SSD).
