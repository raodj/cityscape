A conspicous update that now adds functionality to determine route between
two given buildings. The path finder class currently runs as a standalone
program that can:
    1. Load the model generated by model generator
    2. Compute the path between two buildings using Dikstra's algorithm

Currently the path finding is based just on distance and not on time
(based on speed limits on streets).

Th emodel generator took a bug fix to change a variable "oneWay" from
bool to int.

This check-in also includes some general clean-up of files and
streamlining the archive.
